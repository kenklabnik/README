# Ken Klabnik

I'm a data scientist and software developer operating out of western PA. Immediately relevant skills include Python, JupyterNotebook, pandas, scikit-learn, and machine learning.

On this GitHub you'll mostly see several projects from TripleTen's data science bootcamp related to the above skillset. There are also a few older projects.
