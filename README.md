# Ken Klabnik

I'm a data scientist and software developer operating out of western PA. Immediately relevant skills include Python, JupyterNotebook, pandas, scikit-learn, and machine learning. Before that I wrote Java code for a financial institution, and even before that I was a musician! 

On this GitHub you'll mostly see several projects from TripleTen's data science bootcamp related to the data science skillset. Table of contents for that: https://github.com/kenklabnik/Data_projects_TripleTen
